#### Move `autopilots` into `autopilot_state`

##1657 by @peterjan

This migrates the `autopilots` to a single `autopilot_state` table, effectively removing the concept of multiple autopilots.

### Features

- Add host_sectors table
- Fix 00030_host_sectors migration on DBs that have a host_sectors table
- Integrate RHP4 for uploads
- Move hosts allowRedundantIPs config
- Remove current period
- Remove migrationSurchargeMultiplier from the gouging settings.
- Update UI to v0.68.0

#### Add openapi.yml file with autopilot routes

Added an openapi.yml spec with the specifications for the autopilot routes and a CI step to validate it. The goal is to eventually have a complete spec for the V2 API that we can use to generate API docs as well as making sure that there is always a valid spec for every given commit in the repo.
